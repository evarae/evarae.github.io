    const text = 'Bio for press kit: Ripship is a sci-fi psych-rock band hailing from Auckland, New Zealand. Eva-Rae McLean (drums and vocals) and Callum Lincoln (guitar and vocals) were both heavily influenced by the Tamaki all-ages gig scene from 2015-2017, but wouldnâ€™t meet until later in 2018.\n'+
    '\nThe duo have been described as \"the Tesla of music\" and \"the best goddamn rock band in this hemisphere\". These claims are yet to be debunked. Filthy riffs sit atop hypnotic synth loops while the band dissects topics such as the lubrication of Rubik\'s cubes and the heat death of the universe. Board the Ripship, and set course for the mosh pit.'
